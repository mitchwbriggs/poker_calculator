# POKER CALCULATOR

# Overview
Generate win probability estimates for specific Texas Hold'em scenarios using a GUI. The application takes in your cards, the cards on the board, and the number of opponents remaining in the hand as inputs. Monte Carlo simulations are run on the backend and the resultant win percentage is returned as an output. The estimate typically falls within +/- 1 percentage point of the actual win probability value.

Please note that the project is a work-in-progress! The GUI is still quite crude and does not feature any error handling. Simulation performance also has substantial room for improvement. That said, the program is more than sufficient for it's most likely use case: generating a quick-and-dirty hand equity estimate. Enjoy! (:
